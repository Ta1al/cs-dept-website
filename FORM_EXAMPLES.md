## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple required fields, add optional details
2. **User Experience**: Group related fields logically
3. **Data Quality**: Use dropdowns for standardized responses
4. **Flexibility**: Mix required and optional fields based on necessity
5. **Context**: Tailor fields to the specific event type and needs
6. **Validation**: Use appropriate field types for automatic validation
7. **Privacy**: Only collect necessary information

These examples show how the custom form fields feature can be adapted to any type of event while maintaining consistency and user experience.
